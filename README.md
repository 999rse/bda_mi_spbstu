# BDA Task 1

## Assignments

1. Graph the data (barplot)
2. Check the relationship between the observed variable and the intensity of smoking by methods of classical statistics (Chi-square).
3. Analyze the relationship between the observed variable and the intensity of smoking data using GLM (Poisson's model)
4. Check the dependence of the observed variable on two factors - smoking intensity and coffee intensity (Poisson model). Whether the interaction of factors is significant. Select the optimal model using AIC and BIC.

## Addition

The __csv__ file shows the results of a case-control study on the effects of cigarette smoking and coffee consumption on myocardial infarction (MI) for a sample of men under 55 years of age.
